This program is a Basic Calculator developed using the C programming language. It allows the user to perform four fundamental arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. The program takes two numerical inputs from the user and an operator symbol to determine the required operation.

A switch-case structure is used to select and execute the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the operator entered by the user. The program also includes a condition to handle division by zero, ensuring safe and error-free execution.

This calculator program helps in understanding key C programming concepts such as input/output operations, switch-case statements, arithmetic operators, conditional checking, and basic logic building, making it suitable for beginners and academic mini-assignments.
