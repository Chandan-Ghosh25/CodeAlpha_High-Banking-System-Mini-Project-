# CodeAlpha_High-Banking-System-Mini-Project-

The Bank Account Management System is a console-based application developed using the C programming language. This project is designed to simulate basic banking operations with a simple and user-friendly, menu-driven interface. It enables users to manage bank accounts efficiently by performing essential functions such as creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking account balance.

The system uses structures to store account-related information such as account number, account holder’s name, and balance. To ensure data persistence, file handling is implemented so that account details are saved in a file and remain available even after the program is closed. Each banking operation is implemented using separate functions, which improves code modularity, readability, and maintainability.

This project demonstrates practical use of core C programming concepts including structures, functions, switch-case statements, looping, and file input/output operations. It is ideal for beginners and students as a mini-project to understand how real-world banking systems work at a basic level while strengthening their programming fundamentals.
